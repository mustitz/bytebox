# bytebox

A high-performance, cache-aware memory management system.
It provides direct control over data layout and memory placement.

## Overview

Traditional databases hide memory organization behind abstractions.
`bytebox` gives developers explicit control over how data is stored and accessed in memory.
Built in C using memory-mapped files, structure-of-arrays layouts, and explicit cache-line alignment.
This maximizes memory throughput and minimizes latency.

## Key Features

**Direct Memory Layout Control** - Define exact byte-level data structures.
Explicit cache-line alignment and memory placement.

**Container-Based Access** - Support for arrays, hash tables, trees, and graphs.
Direct memory access patterns for all containers.

**Container-Based Access** - Support for arrays, hash tables, trees, heaps ...
Direct memory access patterns for all containers.

**Cache-Conscious Design** - Explicit processor cache optimization.
Aligned data structures and predictable memory access patterns.

**Zero-Copy Operations** - Memory-mapped files enable direct data access.
No serialization overhead.

**Cross-Process Sharing** - Persistent memory-mapped storage.
Multiple processes can share data structures safely.

**Predictable Performance** - No garbage collection or hidden allocations.
No query optimization overhead.
Deterministic memory access patterns.

## Target Use Cases

- High-frequency data structures (sports statistics, game databases, product catalogs)
- Real-time applications where SQL parsing overhead is too slow
- Systems requiring explicit cache control and memory layout optimization
- Applications needing both persistence and in-memory performance
